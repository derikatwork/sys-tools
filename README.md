## Installation & Update Tools

Each section is seperated based on OS.

There is an Initial Setup script & General Update script.

### Initial Setup
Setup's general PPA's used for daily life.
Makes Directories for Debs & AppImages.
Downloads Debs & AppImage files into Directories for retention.
Installs AppImage using AppImageLauncher, allowing AppImages to be used like normal applications.
Downloads, installs and sets up Flatpak (or snap) applications.
(Snaps may be used on some server builds, as I prefer snaps to Flatpak for servers and Flatpak for Desktop/Workstation. Snaps may also be used on Ubuntu-based installs where Snaps are the better option over Flatpaks)
